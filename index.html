            <p>His actions,both on and off the pitch,have been a motivation for everyone. Throughout his career, Leo has been involved in charitable efforts aimed at helping vulnerable children, a commitment that stems in part from the medical difficulties he faced in his own childhood. </p>
            <p>In March 2010, Leo was appointed a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. Immediately following his appointment, he travelled to Haiti with UNICEF to bring public awareness to the plight of the country's children in the wake of the earthquake.</p>
            <p>In addition to his work with UNICEF, Leo founded his own charitable organization, the Leo Messi Foundation, which invests in health-care services to improve children’s lives. Most recently, he supported efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, sharing prevention practices and promoting fundraising messages to support UNICEF’s emergency response plan.</p>
            <p>Messi has won a record seven Ballon d'Or awards, a record six European Golden Shoes, and in 2020 was named to the Ballon d'Or Dream Team. Until leaving the club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with Barcelona, where he won a club-record 35 trophies, including ten La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and four UEFA Champions Leagues. A prolific goalscorer and creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals in La Liga (474), a La Liga and European league season (50), most hat-tricks in La Liga (36) and the UEFA Champions League (8), and most assists in La Liga (192), a La Liga season (21) and the Copa América (17). He also holds the record for most international goals by a South American male (80). Messi has scored over 750 senior career goals for club and country, and has the most goals by a player for a single club.</p>
